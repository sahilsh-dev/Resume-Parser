# Resume Parser

Resume Parser is an application that allows you to upload resume files 
and then the application automatically extracts important data like
name, email id, phone numbers etc.
This data is then added to an excel sheet which can be downloaded.

## Technologies Used
Initially the idea was to use flask for the backend and create an api through it.
But this time, I wanted to try something new, thus I chose streamlit.
